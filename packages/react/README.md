# Component Hooks

Super charge your component development with ready to use logic and you UI. Component Hooks is a headless react hooks library that adds logic for you components so that you can build beautiful and maintainable code super fast.

## The Problem

1. UI Libraries provide ready to use components. But every app has its own design guildines due to which almost every time one has to override styles or create custom wrapper components

2. Creating components from scratch requires a lot of thought. The logic must be built carefully and therefore sometimes we don't get to spend time on the UI

## Advantages
1. You get complete control over the UI of the component
2. Componenet development time is 2x less
3. Maintaing code is also easy. The UI and the logic are completely decoupled therefore undertsnading the code becomes super easy
